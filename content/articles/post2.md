I'm starting to use the <ins>**[mdzk tool](https://mdzk-rs.github.io)**</ins> to post about technical subjects, and here I'm going to leave some distracting notes.
Mdzk is a tool built in <ins>**[Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)**</ins>, and if you also want a smart and easy tool I recommend it to you.
